# hurl README

This extension provides a very basic syntax highlight for .hurl files. More details about Hurl can be located at their website - hurl.dev. I am in no way related or involved
with this project.

## Features

This extension makes it easier to read your hurl files. There are some additional syntax hightlighting that will need to be added in the future.
